      <header><h1>2. Weekly maximum working hours and opting out</h1>
      </header><p>Employers can't force adults to work more than 48 hours a week on average - normally <a href="calculating-your-working-hours">averaged over 17 weeks</a>. </p>

      <h2>Exceptions</h2>

      <p>These rules don't apply to jobs:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>where the working time is not measured and the worker is in control - eg managing executives with control over their decisions</li>
        <li>in the armed forces, emergency services and police - in some circumstances</li>
        <li>in security and surveillance</li>
        <li>as a domestic servant in a private household  </li>
        <li>where 24-hour staffing is required</li>
        <li>certain categories of seafarers, sea-fishermen and workers on vessels on inland waterways</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Other work sectors might have different rules on maximum working hours and workers should always speak to their employer.</p>

      <div class="application-notice info-notice">
        <p>If youâ€™re a trainee doctor the 48-hour maximum working hours rule applies to you, <a href="calculating-your-working-hours">averaged over 26 weeks</a>.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Opting out of the 48-hour week</h2>

      <p>Workers 18 or over who want to work more than 48 hours a week, can choose to opt out of the 48-hour limit. </p>

      <p>This could be for a certain period or indefinitely. It must be voluntary and in writing.</p>

      <p>It can't be contained in an agreement with the whole workforce. However, employers are allowed to ask individual workers if they'd be willing to opt out.</p>

      <p>An employer shouldn't sack or unfairly treat a worker (eg refused promotion) for refusing to sign an opt-out.</p>

      <h3>Workers who can't opt out</h3>

      <p>Employers must not allow the following staff to opt out:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>workers on ships or boats</li>
        <li>airline staff</li>
        <li>workers in the road transport industry, eg delivery drivers (except for drivers of vehicles under 3.5 tonnes using <a href="/drivers-hours/gb-domestic-rules">GB Domestic drivers' hours rules</a>)</li>
        <li>other staff who travel in and operate vehicles covered by EU rules on drivers' hours, eg bus conductors</li>
        <li>security guards on a vehicle carrying high-value goods</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Cancelling an opt-out agreement</h3>
      <p>A worker can cancel their opt-out agreement whenever they want - even if it's part of their employment contract.</p>

      <p>They must give their employer at least 7 days' notice. This could be longer (up to 3 months) if the worker previously agreed this in the written opt-out agreement with the employer.</p>

      <p>The employer isn't allowed to force a worker to cancel their opt-out agreement.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <p><strong>Example of opt-out agreement:</strong></p>

        <p>I [worker's name] agree that I may work for more than an average of 48 hours a week. If I change my mind, I will give my employer [amount of time - up to 3 months'] notice in writing to end this agreement.
        Signed..............
        Dated...............</p>
      </div>

      <h2>16 and 17 year olds</h2>

      <p>16 and 17 year olds can't normally work more than 8 hours a day or 40 hours a week.</p>

      <p>The hours can't be averaged out for 16 and 17 year olds. There is also no opt-out which means that they can't work longer hours even if they want to.</p>
